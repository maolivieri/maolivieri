I am currently working as a product owner of a series of applications focused on restaurants, bars and pubs. ([â€ŽVectron Systems Apps on the AppÂ Store](https://apps.apple.com/au/developer/vectron-systems-victoria-pty-ltd/id1193822530) 

My day-to-day comprise not only the tasks of a product owner but also managing the team, managing the scrum, managing the app implementation and technical support to the customer.

<!-- My day-to-day include:

- Prioritization of tasks
- Scoping features and logics
- Team management
- Manage the scrum
- Coordinate app projects and implementation (from scope, training, setup and launch)
- Technical support to customers -->

Even though I have never worked as a developer, I have a passion for coding, creating logic and developing effective code.

My experience and knowledge in DevOps help me as a developer, in addition I am always looking into applying tests and CD/CI to achieve agile development.

During my career I had the chance to work in several fields, including engineering, supply chain, software implementation and project management. This has helped me to think outside the box and makes it easier for me to learn new technologies and methods.
